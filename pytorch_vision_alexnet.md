```python
import torch
model = torch.hub.load('pytorch/vision', 'alexnet', pretrained=True)
model.eval()
```

All pre-trained models expect input images normalized in the same way,
i.e. mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape `(3 x H x W)`, where `H` and `W` are expected to be at least `224`.
The images have to be loaded in to a range of `[0, 1]` and then normalized using `mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`
and `std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`.

Here's a sample execution.

```python
# sample execution (requires torchvision)
from PIL import Image
from torchvision import transforms
input_image = Image.open('dog.jpg')
preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])
input_tensor = preprocess(input_image)
input_batch = input_tensor.unsqueeze(0) # create a mini-batch as expected by the model
output = model(input_batch)
# Tensor of shape 1000, with confidence scores over Imagenet's 1000 classes
print(output[0])
# The output has unnormalized scores. To get probabilities, you can run a softmax on it.
print(torch.nn.functional.softmax(output[0]))

```

### Model Description

AlexNet competed in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge on September 30, 2012. The network achieved a top-5 error of 15.3%, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up. The original paper's primary result was that the depth of the model was essential for its high performance, which was computationally expensive, but made feasible due to the utilization of graphics processing units (GPUs) during training.

The 1-crop error rates on the imagenet dataset with the pretrained model are listed below.

| Model structure | Top-1 error | Top-5 error |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  alexnet        | 43.45       | 20.91       |
