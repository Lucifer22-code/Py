```python
import torch
hub_model = torch.hub.load('nvidia/DeepLearningExamples', 'nvidia_tacotron2')
```
will load the Tacotron2 model pre-trained on [LJ Speech dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)

### Model Description

The Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow model form a text-to-speech system that enables user to synthesise a natural sounding speech from raw transcripts without any additional prosody information. The Tacotron 2 model produces mel spectrograms from input text using encoder-decoder architecture. WaveGlow (also available via torch.hub) is a flow-based model that consumes the mel spectrograms to generate speech.

This implementation of Tacotron 2 model differs from the model described in the paper. Our implementation uses Dropout instead of Zoneout to regularize the LSTM layers.

### Example

In the example below:
- pretrained Tacotron2 and Waveglow models are loaded from torch.hub
- Tacotron2 generates mel spectrogram given tensor represantation of an input text ("Hello world, I missed you")
- Waveglow generates sound given the mel spectrogram
- the output sound is saved in an 'audio.wav' file

To run the example you need the following python packages installed:
> numpy, scipy, librosa, unidecode, inflect, librosa

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
from scipy.io.wavfile import write

tacotron2 = torch.hub.load('nvidia/DeepLearningExamples', 'nvidia_tacotron2')
tacotron2 = tacotron2.cuda()
tacotron2.eval()

waveglow = torch.hub.load('nvidia/DeepLearningExamples', 'nvidia_waveglow')
waveglow = waveglow.remove_weightnorm(waveglow)
waveglow = waveglow.cuda()
waveglow.eval()

text = "hello world, I missed you"
sequence = np.array(tacotron2.text_to_sequence(text, ['english_cleaners']))[None, :]
sequence = torch.from_numpy(sequence).cuda().long()

with torch.no_grad():
    _, mel, _, _ = tacotron2.infer(sequence)
    audio = waveglow.infer(mel)

write("audio.wav", 22050, audio[0].data.cpu().numpy())
```
